# Since February 2021 I am Finishing a BSBA in IT Management


Since February 2021 I decided to focus sole on my Bachelor of Science Business Administration, Information Technology Management, and finish it as soon as possible. I am currently coding daily for my job. Once I am done with BSBA I will continue to post more side projects. 

It has been a crazy journey where I have been able to complete 19 courses so far with 8 courses left I am in a good track to complete my BSBA before the end of my first term in Augost 31. Therefore, I could not focus on side projects.
